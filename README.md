## Take My Money! (Donations/Support)
If you insist, I have money pits provided for you:<br>
[Here (Patreon) - If you only hate money](https://www.patreon.com/amyseni/membership) <br>
[Here (PayPal) - If you hate money AND Patreon](https://paypal.me/OrganikMod?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US)<br>
_DeFi wallet(s)/other donation methods available on special request/just come find me on discord @amyseni_ <br>

**Donations should always be viewed as precisely that, donations.** While there are benefits/rewards associated with your generosity (on Patreon always, but available on request to donations outside Patreon, subject to my ability to effectively distrbiute/manage--so don't count on it). <br><br>
**These are not products available for purchase**, merely a representation of my thanks for your support. In the event of a sudden influx of new members, please understand that there may be unforeseen issues/delays in making these available to everyone. In the event this happens, please reach out to me on Discord (link below, @amyseni) and I will do my best to find a solution that will make things right. Reward tiers may change (with advance notice via Discord) <br><br>
Truly, **the best way you can support** me/the project is by **sharing with anyone you know** who might be interested. For Synthetik particularly, we are especially fighting against the fact that many people have given up hope that the game's many issues can/will ever be fixed. If word gets out there far enough, they will come running.<br>
