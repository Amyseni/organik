### Other Projects / Libraries / Art & Audio / Special Thanks
*(any code included in any mod version, past or present--including code indirectly based on existing projects. Art, sfx, music--always used with permission. Active/involved community members. Anyone else Organik couldn't exist without). In no particular order.*

[Kilburn (@FixItVinh)](https://x.com/fixitvinh) (Creator of ZHL/[Antibirth](https://www.antibirth.com/)) - Genius/Brain person, inspired me to be more than I thought possible.
[Archie](https://github.com/Archie-osu) (Creator of [Aurie](https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie) / [YYToolkit](https://github.com/AurieFramework/YYToolkit), oracle of gamemaker secrets/cool person extraordinaire) -- Saved me from an unknowable length of time reverse engineering an entire GameMaker.<br>
@en.ge ( [ART (cara.app) ](https://cara.app/enge) ) - Concept art, Banner art (Patreon, Youtube), idea bouncer, inspirer of things. Did I mention art? Also an artist. A really good one. Like dam.<br>
@NotYourSagittarius ([tweeter](https://x.com/NY_Sagittarius )) - The Mushroom profile-pic/icon art (MushBot). Also just a very cool person (insanely talented)<br>
@simonsis (AGAIN??) - The only reason I got good enough at Synthetik to care about modding it.<br>
@tactu - Keeping me on track, "that one guy from synthcord from way back when", maybe the person outside myself who cares most deeply about this mod being done "right," and not just "done." (Beau is also in the running)<br>
@beauregarde_35490 - "lunatic on-call," THE LOUD ONE, purveyor of cursed Synthetik 1 secrets. Has never been accused of not playing enough Synthetik.<br>
@omnx - ADHD Squirrel/DistractionFactory::Create()/"I bet you could train an LLM to do this" incarnate. Also saved me countless hours of spinning in circles/weeks of potential dev time<br>
Aurie/YYToolkit (links above) - The rock solid foundation upon which I constructed this rickety 100ft ladder. The basis I've used for all gamemaker structs/types/YYC binary format (this cut at least a year of dev time, probably more).<br>
[ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut) -- Does what it says on the tin. I don't even want to think about the reality where I kept on with my own GUI "solution" (read: problem)<br>
[Tiny Mod Injector](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Tools/TinyModInjector)<br> -- Freed me from the peril of trying to support a launcher .exe / installer package for both Proton AND Windows itself. (effectively saving me from writing TinyModInjector)
[CallbackManagerMod - hooking/callbacks library.](https://github.com/PippleCultist/CallbackManagerMod) -- **The** "it just works" callbacks/hooking package for YYToolkit. Seriously, it just does the thing and that is magical all by itself.<br>
(and other [PippleCultist](https://github.com/PippleCultist) works, inspiration and code references.)<br>

## Take My Money! (Donations/Support)
If you insist, I have money pits provided for you:<br>
[Here (Patreon) - If you only hate money](https://www.patreon.com/amyseni/membership) <br>
[Here (PayPal) - If you hate money AND Patreon](https://paypal.me/OrganikMod?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US)<br>
_DeFi wallet(s)/other donation methods available on special request/just come find me on discord @amyseni_ <br><br>
**Donations should always be viewed as precisely that, donations.** While there are benefits/rewards associated with your generosity (on Patreon always, but available on request to donations outside Patreon, subject to my ability to effectively distrbiute/manage--so don't count on it). <br><br>
**These are not products available for purchase**, merely a representation of my thanks for your support. In the event of a sudden influx of new members, please understand that there may be unforeseen issues/delays in making these available to everyone. In the event this happens, please reach out to me on Discord (link below, @amyseni) and I will do my best to find a solution that will make things right. Reward tiers may change (with advance notice via Discord) <br><br>
Truly, **the best way you can support** me/the project is by **sharing with anyone you know** who might be interested. For Synthetik particularly, we are especially fighting against the fact that many people have given up hope that the game's many issues can/will ever be fixed. If word gets out there far enough, they will come running.<br>
