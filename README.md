# Foreword / "Just Type Commit"
This entire set of projects I am working on follows a principle--inspired (unintentionally) by [Kilburn](#people)--that by its own definition, I am compelled to share with you all:<br><br>Commit now. Just do it. Go to your terminal, type `commit -a`, write ANYTHING and send it. In fact, work towards a commit for every successful build/compile. Stop worrying, make a new branch, forget about (main/master) for a while and just keep posting your work. You can figure out what version(s) are main-worthy as you test and iterate. In my opinion, open sourcing even the things you struggle to be proud of is the only way to truly reveal the space that would have been left `void` by your silence.

@inspectorboat - Direct Donation / Other
=======
@inspectorboat - Direct Donation / Other. Project would be dead in the water if not for Boat encouraging me/pushing me to figure things out and letting me talk her ear off at all hours of the damn day. And then still gave more on top of that.

>>>>>>> 06c653f (Update README.md)
  - @simonsis (AGAIN??) - The only reason I got good enough at Synthetik to care about modding it.<br>
  - @tactu - Keeping me on track, "that one guy from synthcord from way back when", maybe the person outside myself who cares most deeply about this mod being done "right," and not just "done." (Beau is also in the running)<br>
  - @beauregarde_35490 - "lunatic on-call," THE LOUD ONE, purveyor of cursed Synthetik 1 secrets. Has never been accused of not playing enough Synthetik.<br>
  - @omnx - ADHD Squirrel/DistractionFactory::Create()/"I bet you could train an LLM to do this" incarnate. Also saved me countless hours of spinning in circles/weeks of potential dev time<br>

### Projects
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - Aurie/YYToolkit (links above) - The rock solid foundation upon which I constructed this rickety 100ft ladder. The basis I've used for all gamemaker structs/types/YYC binary format (this cut at least a year of dev time, probably more).<br>
  - [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut) -- Does what it says on the tin. I don't even want to think about the reality where I kept on with my own GUI "solution" (read: problem)<br>
  - [Tiny Mod Injector](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Tools/TinyModInjector)<br> -- Freed me from the peril of trying to support a launcher .exe / installer package for both Proton AND Windows itself. (effectively saving me from writing TinyModInjector)
  - [CallbackManagerMod - hooking/callbacks library.](https://github.com/PippleCultist/CallbackManagerMod) -- **The** "it just works" callbacks/hooking package for YYToolkit. Seriously, it just does the thing and that is magical all by itself.<br>
      - (and other [PippleCultist](https://github.com/PippleCultist) works (incl. HolocureMultiplayerMod): inspiration and code references.)<br>

# Licensing
[Organik - GPL3](https://github.com/Amyseni/organik/blob/master/LICENSE)<br>
[LibZHL (and LibZHLGen) (created by Kilburn/FixItVinh)/Direktor - MIT](https://github.com/Amyseni/organik/blob/AmyDev/LICENSE-LibZHL) Direktor is the Magic Sauce that provides all the new fancy hooks (coming soon, also Direktor full release coming soon). Based on LibZHL by [Kilburn (@FixItVinh)](https://x.com/FixItVinh/), with improvements by the [FTL Hyperspace](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace) team. Finally, standalone version and GameMaker specialization by myself. -- **Always** attribute to Kilburn (@FixItVinh).<br>
=======
  - Aurie/YYToolkit (links above) - The rock solid foundation upon which I constructed this rickety 100ft ladder to nowhere. The GOAT libraries that got me started understanding GameMaker/YYC to where I am now (aka--still clueless). The OG source for all gamemaker structs/types/the YYC binary format used in all my code here. (This saved at least a year of dev time, probably a lot more).<br>
  - [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut) -- Does what it says on the tin. I don't even want to think about the reality where I kept on with my own GUI "solution" (read: problem)<br>
  - [Tiny Mod Injector](https://github.com/YAL-Game-Tools/TinyModInjector)<br> -- Freed me from the peril of trying to support a launcher .exe / installer package for both Proton AND Windows itself. (effectively saving me from writing TinyModInjector)
  - [CallbackManagerMod - hooking/callbacks library.](https://github.com/PippleCultist/CallbackManagerMod) -- **The** "it just works" callbacks/hooking package for YYToolkit and GameMaker games. Seriously, it just does the thing and that is magical all by itself.<br>
      - (and other [PippleCultist](https://github.com/PippleCultist) works (incl. HolocureMultiplayerMod): inspiration and code references.)<br>
  - LibZHL/LibZHLGen (now Direktor and Komposer) - The "Magic Sauce" that defines, locates, and creates hooks / definitions for detouring or even just calling ANY function. Does raw assembly and/or typedef function trampoline hax to allow defined functions to be called the same way they were originally defined, as well as hooks executing under their *original* context (including `thiscall`, `fastcall`, even `userpurge`).
     - Created by [Kilburn (@FixItVinh)](https://x.com/FixItVinh/) (see above) for his mod Antibirth (later Repentance). Modified briefly by myself and TheSwiftTiger, then by the [FTL Hyperspace](https://github.com/FTL-Hyperspace/FTL-Hyperspace) team, then back to me as I combined bits from across all of these iterations, hopefully towards a release for GameMaker games specifically and compatibility for doing things the hard way for any game.

_DeFi wallet(s)/other donation methods available on special request/just come find me on discord @amyseni_ <br><br>
**Donations should always be viewed as precisely that, donations.** While there are benefits/rewards associated with your generosity (on Patreon always, but available on request to donations outside Patreon, subject to my ability to effectively distrbiute/manage--so don't count on it). <br><br>
**These are not products available for purchase**, merely a representation of my thanks for your support. In the event of a sudden influx of new members, please understand that there may be unforeseen issues/delays in making these available to everyone.

Truly, **the best way you can support** me/the project is by **sharing with anyone you know** who might be interested. For Synthetik particularly, we are especially fighting against the fact that many people have given up hope that the game's many issues can/will ever be fixed. If word gets out there far enough, they will come running.<br>
